# fillit #####developed by: ##Zackary Smith & Arthur Zhuk
_fillit_ is project that allows for searching for the optimal
solution among a large set of tetrimino piece possibilities.
fillit features an algorithm which fits tetriminos together
into the smallest possible square grid.

A **tetrimino** is a 4 block geometric figure as found in the game
Tetris.

*fillit* doesn't consist of recoding Tetris but rather taking in a
file as an argument which contains a list of tetriminos which are 4x4 in size.
Our approach to finding the smallest possible square the pieces could
fit into involves implementing a backtracking algorithm.
